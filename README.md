## DELIVERABLE #1 - PROJECT PROPOSAL 

For this required deliverable, we are presenting the title of the project with a set of functional and non-functional requirements that are required for the software project we have selected to work on. 

This project was initially designed in SOFE2800U (Web Programming), as such we have decided to select this as our software project. 

## Functional Requirements

## Non-Functional Requirements
Level Difficulties - Every level should be increasingly more difficult, as this is what gives a competetive feel to the game. When the user beats a level, the next level they move on to will require more points within a lesser amount of moves.
