## Functional Requirements

### **1) Hi-Score Tracking** 
This functional requirement should allow the user to be encouraged to play competitively or casually amongst friends or other online users. This should also give the user the opportunity to view their own scores to improve if they so desire to. 

### **2) Software Platform** 
The requirement should mainly focus on allowing the user to have access to the software through a web-based experience due to the non-capabilities to design the software project through any other means at the current moment. This software platform functional requirement will be able to be adjusted once further experience and knowledge is available. 

### **3) Combo Sequence Capability**
This functional requirement allows the user to gain points through a combo sequence of matching items/objects in a row or column of 3-4. As an important part to the purpose of this software, this functional requirement has a lot of focus on being able to be executed successfully and without issues. 

### **4) Hi-Score System**
This functional requirement is tied with the Functional Requirement #1, where the user should be able to compare their scores with other users or themselves. Both requirements are interrelated since there needs to be a system designed to track the hi-scores in general. 

### **5) Multiple Levels**
The design of this software project requires the user to be able to collect a hi-score, and to do that they must be able to gain points by completing levels. This functional requirement requires the user to pass through levels after successfully completing the current level and gaining the required points. 

## Non-Functional Requirements 

### **1.1) Level Difficulties**
Every level should be increasingly more difficult, as this is what gives a competetive feel to the game. When the user beats a level, the next level they move on to will require more points within a lesser amount of moves.

### **1.2) Downloadable/purchasable content**
The user will be able to purchase or download limited edition content; this will allow for the game content to be updated keeping the user experience fresh and fun.

### **1.3) Different Themes**
As the user progresses through the game, we want to allow for different themes inbetween each level. This will allow for the game to keep from becoming old and redundant in the space of user experience.

### **1.4) Easily Accessable**
We wish for our users to be able to play our game anywhere we go. With that we will attempt to make the game accessable from computers, laptops, or even smartphones.

### **1.5) Advertisement Remover**
As we plan for our game to be free to play, we will need to use ads to bring in revenue in order to continue support for the game. However we plan to offer a purchasable advertisement remover, which will allow the user to get rid of annoying ad's while still being able to support us and play our game.
